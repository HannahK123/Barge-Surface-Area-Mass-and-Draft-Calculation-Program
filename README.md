# Barge-Surface-Area-Mass-and-Draft-Calculation-Program
This Python program, my first project in my first year of computer science, calculates a barge's surface area, mass, and draft height based on user input for its dimensions. It factors in the barge's open top, calculates the mass using iron's density, and determines how much of the barge is submerged.
